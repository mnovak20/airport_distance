 ****
 make sure you have node and grunt first
 ****

 1. Run 'npm install'
 2. Run 'bower install'
 3. Run 'gulp dev'


The app is based on AngularJS and uses several other libraries such as ui.bootstrap and ngMap for typeahead and google map polyline functionalities.

The dataset for airports came from openflights.org (http://openflights.org/data.html) and they claim the data is as of Jan 2012. 

Their dataset includes train stations and cruise terminals but given that you can book plane tickets originating from train stations I didn't take non-airport data out.
